# MySQL

This project revolves around understanding database management, replication, and backup strategies. I configured MySQL servers in a primary-replica setup, focusing on the provided learning objectives. Additionally, I wrote a script Bash solution to automate the backup process, ensuring adherence to specified requirements and guidelines.
