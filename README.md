# System Engineering and DevOps - Bash, Networking & Security, CI/CD

This repository contains programs written for the system engineering and DevOps track at ALX Africa. In these projects, I worked with Bash and practiced writing Bash scripts to automate tasks. I learned about the OSI model and various Linux networking tools. The specific list of projects contained follows:
