# Web stack debugging #2

In this project, I worked on diagnosing and fixing broken web stacks within isolated containers. My main responsibility was to restore the web stacks to a functional state. To streamline the process, I developed scripts to automate the necessary commands for debugging and fixing each web stack.

# Tasks ðŸ“ƒ

# 0. Run software as another user

  + <u>[0-iamsomeoneelse]()</u>: Bash script that accepts one argument and run the whoami command under the user passed as an argument.

# 1. Run Nginx as Nginx

  + <u>[1-run_nginx_as_nginx]()</u>: Bash script that configures the container so that Nginx listen all active IPs on port 8080.
