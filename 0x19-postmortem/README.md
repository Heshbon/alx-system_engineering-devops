# Postmortem

This project involved understanding the concept of on-call duty. It emphasizes that any software system can fail due to factors such as bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, and human error. Failure presents an opportunity for learning and improvement; thus, it's crucial for software engineers to learn from mistakes to prevent recurrence. A postmortem is essential in the tech industry, serving two main goals: providing employees with clear insights into outage causes and impacts, and ensuring thorough root cause analysis to prevent future incidents.
