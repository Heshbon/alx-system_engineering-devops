# Web stack debugging #1

In this web stack debugging project, I was tasked with diagnosing and fixing the issue preventing Nginx from listening on port 80 in an Ubuntu container. Using my debugging skills, I will identify the root cause of the problem and implement a solution to ensure Nginx is running and listening on port 80 of all active IPv4 IPs.
