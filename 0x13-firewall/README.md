# Firewall

In this project, I focused on web stack debugging, especially on configuring firewalls for my web servers. Using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall), I ensured that my servers are protected while allowing legitimate traffic. I also learned to use telnet for testing server connectivity and was cautious about not blocking port 22/TCP to prevent SSH access issues.
