# Configuration management

In this project, I became acquainted with Puppet as a configuration management tool. I worked on creating Puppet manifest files for the purposes of installing packages, running commands, and creating files.

# 0. Create a file

  + <u>[0-create_a_file.pp]()</u>: Puppet manifest file that creates a file school in the /tmp directory.

# 1. Install a package\

  + <u>[1-install_a_package.pp]()</u>: Puppet manifest that install flask from pip3 v 2.1.0.

# 2. Execute a command

  + <u>[2-execute_a_command.pp]</u>: Puppet manifest file that kills the process killmenow.
