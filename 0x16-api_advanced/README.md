# API advanced

In this project, I delve into advanced API usage with Python scripting, focusing on back-end API operations. The background context emphasizes the importance of API understanding for interviews, suggesting the Reddit API as a valuable resource for practice due to its diverse endpoints and wealth of accessible information. Learning objectives includes skills like reading API documentation, handling pagination, parsing JSON responses, making recursive API calls, and sorting dictionaries by value.

# Tasks ðŸ“ƒ

# 0. How many subs?

  + <u>[0-subs.py]()</u>: Python function that queries the Reddit API and returns the number of subscribers (not active users, total subscribers) for a given subreddit.

  + Returns 0 if an invalid subreddit is given.

# 1. Top Ten

  + <u>[1-top_ten.py]()</u>: Python function that queries the Reddit API and prints the titles of the first 10 hot posts listed for a given subreddit.

  + Prints None if an invalid subreddit is given.

# 2. Recurse it!

  + <u>[2-recurse.py]()</u>: Python function that recursively returns a list containing the titles of all hot articles for a given subreddit.

  + Returns None if no results are found on the given subreddit.
