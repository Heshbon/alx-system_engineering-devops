# 0x0B. SSH

In this project, I became familiar connecting to and working with servers using the SSH protocol. I worked on a server configured with an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment.

# Tasks ðŸ“ƒ

# 0. Use a private key

  + <u>[0-use_a_private_key]()</u>: Bash script that uses ssh to connect to your server using the private key ~/.ssh/school with the user ubuntu.

# 1. Create an SSH key pair

  + <u>[1-create_ssh_key_pair]()</u>: Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.

# 2. Client configuration file

  + <u>[2-ssh_config]()</u>: SSH configuration file for the local SSH client.

	+ SSH client configuration must be configured to use the private key ~/.ssh/school.

	+ SSH client configuration must be configured to refuse to authenticate using a password.

# 3. Let me in!
